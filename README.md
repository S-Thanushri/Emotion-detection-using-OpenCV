# Emotion-detection-using-OpenCV

The main idea of my project is to predict emotions using visual feed such as webcam etc. This project is done by training the fer2013 dataset using simple algorithms. If you need you can add advanced algorithms to train the data even more accurate.

The main.py file is the data processing program. You can download the dataset from kaggle.com or any other well known websites for datasets. Then test and train it. 

The webcam.py file is the program to display the detection of the emotion we establish using a webcam. 

I have also uploaded the trained dataset "facial_expression_recognition.h5" to directly load it in the webcam.py file to run the output.
